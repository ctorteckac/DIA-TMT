Export TMT library as spreadsheet from the Library perspective in Spectromine or Spectronaut

Edit the channels.tsv file to include the reporter ions you want to look for (we have provided for the TMT10-plex and the TMTpro)

Run the TMTLibraryAnnotator.exe with the library path as first parameter

Start new library based Spectronaut search

After adding DIA-TMT raw files to the experiment, click on Assign Spectral Library

Select the 'From File' tab and select the annotated library generated by the TMTLibraryAnnotator.exe

Then start the analysis

Disclaimer - the reporter ions will only be visible with a special licence for Spectronaut from Biognosys. You will then also be able to export them in your report perspective

The TMTLibraryAnnotator_Source folder will allow you to extend it or make it more flexible
